## Zoom

For more information on how to join a Zoom meeting, [check out this video](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362193-How-Do-I-Join-A-Meeting-). If you need support getting on a call, click on Support on the Hub dashboard and chat with our events team. Thankfully, most sessions will be livestreamed and don’t require access to Zoom directly.

## Circle.so

We have made a small simple guide for basic functionality in Circle here. Circle.so also has helpful links on the right-hand side to get started. For more support on how to use Circle, click the Buoy symbol on the right-hand side to ask for support.

## FAccT 2021 Hub

We have a simple walkthrough guide for the Hub as well as pointers on the platform itself. Click on “Look Around” on the left-hand navigation to get tips on how to navigate the platform.

## Sli.do

All attendees are encouraged to ask questions related to specific papers or during any live streamed event on the three stages. Please refer to this guide for any questions on how to use Slido as a conference attendee.
