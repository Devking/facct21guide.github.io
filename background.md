# Hitchhiker's Guide to FAccT 2021

## Background

The countdown to ACM FAccT 2021 has begun! The conference will be held as a completely virtual conference March 4 - 10, 2021. It is our hope that we can invite some of the same curiosity and engaged participation that has defined the previous four years.

The conference brings together researchers and practitioners interested in fairness, accountability, and transparency in socio-technical systems. This is our first conference under the new name, and still builds on the success of the 2020 conference held in Barcelona. This year we are featuring 17 Tutorial sessions, 11 CRAFT sessions, 26 Paper-focused sessions, 3 Keynotes and a lot more. It is our hope that, whether you are new or seasoned alumni, you walk away feeling connected and excited about the work happening in this multidisciplinary research community.

This Guide contains key dates, information about registration, conference tech set-up, and instructions on how to get support before the event.

## How to Prepare for the Program 
The majority of FAccT 2021 occurs on the conference hub. The hub is a custom platform that contains most of the tools you will need to participate in FaaCT 2021. As a registered attendee you will have access to the hub starting on Friday, February 26. We recommend you take some time to familiarize yourself with the space and encourage you to engage with speakers and attendees before the conference begins in our Community space.
 
During the conference, you will explore the hub to watch the sessions, learn about speakers, download papers, and discuss relevant topics with your fellow conference attendees. All you need is a browser, an internet connection, and conference registration on the hub.


## Accessing the Conference
 
**QUICK LINKS**
* [Conference Hub](https://2021.facctconference.org/)
* [Discussion Board](https://facct.circle.so/)

The key features of this year’s event:  

**Pre-recorded talks** for research presentations are available for viewing anytime after February 25. __[Explore the archive of pre-recorded talks.](https://2021.facctconference.org/library)__
 
**Community discussion boards** to interact with attendees outside of sessions via an embedded Circle.so integration. __[Discuss papers, share reading recommendations and more.](https://2021.facctconference.org/library)__
 
**Live Q&A sessions** will be facilitated via Sli.do for Keynotes, Panels, Tutorials, and Paper sessions. All sessions will have access to Sli.do except for sessions that are not live streamed, such as CRAFT. These sessions will have limited capacity, so we encourage you to [plan in advance if you wish to participate](https://forms.gle/GVQPEfpXDdmyKA517). __[Watch the live streams and participate in the Q&A on the conference hub.](https://2021.facctconference.org/)__

Most sessions will be live streamed into three streams on the hub. Some sessions, however, are more interactive and require participants to join the Zoom call. In this case, we ask that you [download the Zoom desktop application](https://zoom.us/download) ahead of time.

Access to live sessions will become available on the scheduled day of the session on our conference live stages. We recommend that you log in a few minutes early since all sessions plan to run on time. 

Some tips to get the most out of FAccT: 
 
1. **If you are unsure you can attend the sessions live, watch the pre-recorded research paper content in advance of the live Q&A sessions.** All attendees have access to the hub where they can watch pre-recorded Paper sessions and submit questions before the session starts. Watch the presentations whenever it is best for you!
2. **Ask a question to an author on the paper’s page before the live Q&A.** Your question will be sent to the session chair so they can prepare for the Q&A.  This will help the authors accommodate any questions raised by attendees who watched the content prior to the start of the conference or are unable to attend live.
3. **Engage on the Community discussion boards, and discuss with the authors and other attendees about the sessions you have watched.** Authors will be instructed specifically to begin monitoring their session boards throughout the event.
4. **Attend the livestream Q&A sessions to engage with the presenters in-person.** Upvote submitted questions and watch as the presenters respond in real time.

## What you need to Attend

**The Right Browser:** We recommend using Chrome for the best user experience. However, our virtual conference portal works well on Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

**Access to Internet:** You will need to have access to the internet in order to access the Hub and watch the livestream.

### FAccT 2021 Hub
Below is a simple walkthrough guide for the hub as well as pointers on the platform itself. Click on “Look Around” on the left-hand navigation to get tips on how to navigate the platform.

#### FAccT Dashboard 

The dashboard is the first area of the virtual platform that you will see after you login. Your login information was sent to you by email from the FAccT Registration Team. From the dashboard you can access all areas of the conference portal. The livestream stages, the on-demand research videos, tutorial and CRAFT sessions, the virtual support desk as well as the community discussion boards. You can also use the navigation bar, at the top and left-side of the main page to help find all areas of the platform. The navigation bars appear on every page and is the best way to move through the different areas. 

![Hub dashboard](/img/hub-dashboard-8.png)

#### FAccT Community Discussion Boards 

FAccT is planning to keep the conversation going outside of the Q&A session with Circle.so. Circle.so is a social platform designed to gather community around content and engage in discussions. There are a variety of social and conference related spaces for you to explore. We highly suggest utilizing the discussion boards to network, engage, ask questions and receive support throughout the week!

#### FAccT Research Paper Pages

Each research paper has a dedicated page that gives an attendee a one-stop place for content related to that single paper. It will feature on-demand videos of the pre-recorded content available starting on Thursday, February 25 and the recorded research paper Q&A sessions. To help remember the time of a paper’s Q&A session we have an add-to calendar reminder. There is also a submit-a-question button to send in questions. This will be a dynamic way to get your question to the presenter for the Q&A session or allow you to connect with the presenter after their designated time to continue the conversation.

![Hub Live Stream](/img/hub-researchpage-7.png)

#### FAccT Livestream Sessions

The FAccT livestream sessions will occur in a stand-alone area of the virtual portal as a livestream. You can access the livesteams from the dashboard or from the navigation bar. All sessions that occur as a livestream cannot be viewed until their scheduled time. When the session starts, an orange ‘play button’ will appear and you can start the session.  Questions can be directed to the speakers by sending in questions through the Sli.do integration on the right of the screen.

## Policy Against Harassment

It is extremely important to the FaaCT organizing team that all presenters and attendees have access to a safe and inclusive conference space in order to participate fully and contribute to this vast interdisciplinary research community. We have developed a variety of systems to limit high-level access and reduce harassment during the conference. Still, no platform is perfect and we want to respond both proactively and reactively.

To facilitate an environment that promotes respect, shared learning and collaboration, we request that all participants abide by the following guidelines:
* Exercise‭ ‬consideration‭ ‬and‭ ‬respect‭ ‬in‭ ‬your‭ ‬speech‭ ‬and‭ ‬actions;‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬
* Refrain‭ ‬from‭ ‬demeaning,‭ ‬discriminatory,‭ ‬or‭ ‬harassing‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬and‭ ‬speech;‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬
* Be mindful of your fellow participants and do not imply that there things that everybody should know;

In attending the FAccT conference, participants abide by [ACM's Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and agree that behavior which deviates from these guidelines will constitute grounds for actions against any attendee. If you are involved in or witness any such incident, please [submit a complaint to the organizing team](https://forms.gle/5oRUK4mytAx1riMJ6) and the members of the Safety and Inclusion team will review the case. 

If a complaint is submitted to the conference, the case will be reviewed by the conference’s Safety and Inclusion Panel. The panel will be composed of three of the following: 1) Conference General Chair, 2) Conference Executive Committee Member, 3) Diversity and Inclusion Chair, 4) Virtual Experience Chair. The panel will convene to review a complaint as soon as feasible and decide based on the code of conduct policies and available or relevant evidence appropriate disciplinary action which can include but not limited to partial or full dismissal from the conference. Regardless of the enforcement decision, the panel should encourage all submitters to [complete a confidential complaint to ACM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_VrrqbwhjfGkSzd3hUgESaRoVDYUowiR-7bopeNnhoE/edit#heading=h.v1zdsdgto5qc).
