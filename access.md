**QUICK LINKS**
* [Conference Hub](https://2021.facctconference.org/)
* [Discussion Board](https://facct.circle.so/)

The key features of this year’s event: 

**Pre-recorded talks** for research presentations are available for viewing anytime after February 25. __[Explore the archive of pre-recorded talks.](https://2021.facctconference.org/library)__

**Community discussion boards** to interact with attendees outside of sessions via an embedded Circle.so integration. __[Discuss papers, share reading recommendations and more.](https://2021.facctconference.org/library)__

**Live Q&A sessions** will be facilitated via Sli.do for Keynotes, Panels, Tutorials, and Paper sessions. All sessions will have access to Sli.do except for sessions that are not live streamed, such as CRAFT. These sessions will have limited capacity, so we encourage you to [plan in advance if you wish to participate](https://forms.gle/GVQPEfpXDdmyKA517). __[Watch the live streams and participate in the Q&A on the conference hub.](https://2021.facctconference.org/)__

Most sessions will be live streamed into three streams on the hub. Some sessions, however, are more interactive and require participants to join the Zoom call. In this case, we ask that you [download the Zoom desktop application](https://zoom.us/download) ahead of time.

Access to live sessions will become available on the scheduled day of the session on our conference live stages. We recommend that you log in a few minutes early since all sessions plan to run on time.

Some tips to get the most out of FAccT:

1. **If you are unsure you can attend the sessions live, watch the pre-recorded research paper content in advance of the live Q&A sessions.** All attendees have access to the hub where they can watch pre-recorded Paper sessions and submit questions before the session starts. Watch the presentations whenever it is best for you!
2. **Ask a question to an author on the paper’s page before the live Q&A.** Your question will be sent to the session chair so they can prepare for the Q&A.  This will help the authors accommodate any questions raised by attendees who watched the content prior to the start of the conference or are unable to attend live.
3. **Engage on the Community discussion boards, and discuss with the authors and other attendees about the sessions you have watched.** Authors will be instructed specifically to begin monitoring their session boards throughout the event.
4. **Attend the livestream Q&A sessions to engage with the presenters in-person.** Upvote submitted questions and watch as the presenters respond in real time.

**The Right Browser:** We recommend using Chrome for the best user experience. However, our virtual conference portal works well on Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
