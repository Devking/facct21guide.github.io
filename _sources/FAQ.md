```{dropdown} Why is the conference not using Gather?


We explored using Gather and we were excited to be able to provide an opportunity for engagement like the hallway conversations and running into people coincidentally that we miss from in person conferences.  However, Gather is has poor accessibility for disabled people, especially blind, low vision, deaf and hard of hearing participants. UbiComp / ISWC 2020 recommended to other ACM conferences that Gather.town NOT be used in the future  unless accessibility issues are addressed. We investigated workarounds and asked Gather about their current accessibility but we were not able to provide a good experience.

We do want to not that in other ways online conferences are more accessible, so we have worked hard to create other ways for people to engage.
