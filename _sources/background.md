# Hitchhiker's Guide to FAccT 2021

## Background

The countdown to ACM FAccT 2021 has begun! The conference will be held as a completely virtual conference March 4 - 10, 2021. It is our hope that we can invite some of the same curiosity and engaged participation that has defined the previous four years.

The conference brings together researchers and practitioners interested in fairness, accountability, and transparency in socio-technical systems. This is our first conference under the new name, and still builds on the success of the 2020 conference held in Barcelona. This year we are featuring 17 Tutorial sessions, 11 CRAFT sessions, 26 Paper-focused sessions, 3 Keynotes and a lot more. It is our hope that, whether you are new or seasoned alumni, you walk away feeling connected and excited about the work happening in this multidisciplinary research community.

This Guide contains key dates, information about registration, conference tech set-up, and instructions on how to get support before the event.

## How to Prepare for the Program 
The majority of FAccT 2021 occurs on the Hub. The Hub is a custom platform we designed that contains most of the tools you will need to participate in FaaCT 2021. As a registered attendee you will have access to FAccT’s virtual conference portal starting on Thursday, February 25. We recommend you take some time to familiarize yourself with the conference portal and encourage you to engage with speakers and attendees before the conference begins!
 
During the conference, you will explore the Hub to watch the sessions, learn about speakers, download papers, and discuss relevant topics with your fellow conference attendees. All you need is a browser, an internet connection, and conference registration on the Hub.

## Accessing the Conference
 
Most sessions will be live streamed into three stages on the Hub. Some sessions, however, are more interactive and require participants to join the Zoom call. In this case, we ask that you [download the Zoom desktop application](https://zoom.us/download) ahead of time. If you need help, please review the Getting Support section below.

Access to live sessions will become available on the scheduled day of the session on our conference live stages. We recommend that you log in a few minutes early since all sessions plan to run on time! 

Authors will be available during the conference to answer questions and discuss their findings through discussion boards found on the Hub. 

The key features of this year’s event:  

**Pre-recorded talks** for research presentations are available for viewing anytime after February 25. Note that all live research paper sessions will have 20-minute pre-recorded content associated with them. Similar themed papers are grouped together and the content will be livestreamed during the first hour and then we will bring the authors together for a live Q&A for the second hour. 
 
**Community discussion boards** to interact with attendees outside of the sessions via Circle.so integration.
 
**Live Q&A sessions** during the main conference itself will be facilitated via Sli.do for keynotes, panelists, tutorials, and research presentations. All sessions will have access to Sli.do except for sessions that are not live streamed, such as CRAFT. These sessions will have limited capacity, so we encourage you to plan in advance if you wish to participate.

## What you need to Attend

**The Right Browser:** We recommend using Chrome for the best user experience. However, our virtual conference portal works well on Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

**Access to Internet:** You will need to have access to the internet in order to access the Hub and watch the livestream.

## Conference Agenda

Please note that all conference times on the portal are in **Coordinated Standard Time (UTC +0)**. You will be able to add events to your own calendar to convert to your local time.

## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Initiative

The FAccT 2021 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion webpage will go live on February 26th, in the meantime, please direct open questions to DEI Chairs to inclusion@facctconference.org.
